          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am first generation Mexican American and come from a family almost entirely comprised of entrepreneurs.  My earliest childhood memories mostly entail my little brother and I riding around with my parents to paint houses, go to the trash dump, or meet up with contractors.  "Make it work" was a phrase I understood long before Tim Gunn and a mantra that still motivates me when there seem to be no good solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was raised in Houston and had two businesses there intermittent with a short career as a recycling consultant.  After falling in love with the Bay Area and out of love with Houston, I finally moved to San Francisco when I started Scholarli, my ed tech business.  Currently I am studying computer science and looking to break into product management.

        When I meet someone I really like and connect with, there usually comes a point in the conversation where I bust out a vision board of one of my concepts or read a rough draft of a piece they're writing.  We naturally want to share our ideas, so this website is where I keep some of mine.  It's certainly not a resume and it looks a lot different than my LinkedIn!  Here you can learn more about the businesses I've started, my passion projects, places I've surfed, and other findings.
