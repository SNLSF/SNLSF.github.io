          Two partners and I raised $1M to buy fourteen abandoned single-family auction homes from the Houston Housing Authority in 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing on my eye for design, I chose every fixture, finishing, and paint color that went into this project- then, as purchasing manager, I sourced and bid on the materials. Working against the approaching home sales season deadline, we were able to sell every house providing a 17% annualized return to our investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was special in a lot of ways.  First, I thrive in fast-paced environments and really enjoy something that requires me to use both my creative and analytical skills.  Second, I was so incredibly proud to show my parents the products we delivered in an industry they had already mastered (they were proud too!).

        When I meet someone I really like and connect with, there usually comes a point in the conversation where I bust out a vision board of one of my concepts or read a rough draft of a piece they're writing.  We naturally want to share our ideas, so this website is where I keep some of mine.  It's certainly not a resume and it looks a lot different than my LinkedIn!  Here you can learn more about the businesses I've started, my passion projects, places I've surfed, and other findings.
