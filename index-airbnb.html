          Since 2011, I have been hosting Airbnb travelers from all over the world at my home in Houston, Texas.  I meet a variety of people who all share a love for modern minimalist design and being in the center of a city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Situated adjacent to the theater district and down the road from George R. Brown Convention Center, the condo is convenient for the business traveler as well as visiting musicians, artists, and performers.  It's not uncommon I have couples escape family life in the Houston suburbs to enjoy a romantic night together in the city.

          If you go out, you'll find a great balance between new bar and restaurant concepts and some of the classic and historical spots like La Caraf and Notsuoh.  If you stay in, open the window above Main St. to hear the occasional saxophonist on the corner or the subtle city sounds.  More than likely, you'll find some beer in the fridge and you can always count on coffee in the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          People ask me about my best and worst experiences being a host all the time.  I would say 90% of my guests have been truly wonderful, 5% have been so/so, and the other 5% have been total nightmares.  If you're considering hosting, I would make one suggestion- don't have anything in your home that you'd be heartbroken to see ruined or stolen.  If you take that precaution, everything else can be replaced with money and you'll have tremendous peace of mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friends and family- please let me know when you are visiting- I'm happy to have you!

        When I meet someone I really like and connect with, there usually comes a point in the conversation where I bust out a vision board of one of my concepts or read a rough draft of a piece they're writing.  We naturally want to share our ideas, so this website is where I keep some of mine.  It's certainly not a resume and it looks a lot different than my LinkedIn!  Here you can learn more about the businesses I've started, my passion projects, places I've surfed, and other findings.
