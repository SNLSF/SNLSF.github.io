          Tavi Gevinson.  Michelle Phan.  Tracy Dinunzio.  Probably not the first names that come to mind when you think women in tech.  Scrap-booking.  Shopping.  Makeup.  Probably the last things you think of when you think of tech.  But, these women have taken their passions, leveraged technology, and created very successful businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stereotypes of the roles women play in technology form in the most obvious place- media.  What happens when we finally get an empowered hack-master leading female role in a movie? Oh that's right, we get The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, a total outcast manrepeller.  Or what about 1995's The Net- heroine debugs a fatal system and saves the day?  Turns out the heroine, though beautiful, devotes her life to her computer and mother, otherwise an antisocial shut-in.  There aren't many more movies or television shows that I can reference to point out good or bad representations of women in tech because, frankly, it's still a man's world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Misconceptions about how women fit in tech also play a part in the under respresentation of women in the industry.  A woman is doing herself and her company a disservice by attempting to do a man's job.  In media we see women pictured in power suits, stifling their emotions, drinking whiskey and smoking cigars to "fit in" with the men.  Women offer unique skills and under no circumstance should downplay their identities.  By empowering the inherent attributes of a woman, we diversify skills, teams, and products. And thus Tavi created Rookie Magazine, Michelle ipsy, and Tracy Tradesy.  These are the types of women that should be present in media.  I would take this opportunity to bash Keeping Up With The Kardashians, BUT Kim K did turn out a damn successful video game!
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of the huge gender gap, women are playing a prominent role in technology- we just need to showcase their successes to younger generations. As James Brown put it, it's a man's world, but it would be nothing without a woman or a girl.
